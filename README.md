# **Uber_Riders_Prediction**

# Problem Statement:
 This project is to predict how many riders are travelling through Uber per week.

# Project Workflow

## 1. Model Building
Model building is done using  Multiple Linear Regression algorithm and obtained an accuracy of more than 90%.

## 2. Create the Flask Application
The file has been run on the Anaconda prompt using python filename.py. 

## 3. Deployment on Heroku
The Heroku platform uses Git as the primary means for deploying applications.
I have created an application on Heroku(prediction-of-uber-riders), it associates a new Git remote, named as Uber_Riders_Prediction , with the local Git repository for our application

>## ðŸ“‚&nbsp; RELEVANT TECHNOLOGY
Any web technology can be used but I am thinking about using Python ecosystem.
